# The Long Version

<br>

Let's rewind a bit and explore my roots, back to my childhood days when curiosity was my middle name! I was that kid who just couldn't resist taking things apart, always itching to see what made them tick. The problem was, I never quite mastered the art of putting them back together again in one piece. Let's just say I left a trail of broken gadgets in my wake, but hey, at least I satisfied my insatiable thirst for knowledge!

Oh, and let me tell you about my wanderlust. I had this burning desire to explore every nook and cranny of the world, and lucky me, I grew up in a country that was an absolute paradise for adventure, Nepal. With majestic mountains towering over me and breathtaking sceneries at every turn, I couldn't help but develop the mantra, "the next corner will always have better views." It was a mindset that fueled my love for discovering new places and at times helped me through some difficult patches in life. And you know what? As time went on, I did learn a thing or two about putting things back together—figuratively, of course. It was then that I made a decision. I knew deep down in my tinkering heart that I wanted to become an engineer

So, after completing school and my A-Levels from home, I left my beloved country and went to India to earn my bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering. Here I spent four exciting years honing my technical skills while also travelling around a country with a rich and vibrant culture. It was during the engineering years that I narrowed my areas of interest into computers networks and then finally Cyber Security.
