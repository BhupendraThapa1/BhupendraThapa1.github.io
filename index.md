Hey there! Imagine a cool virtual hangout spot where I spill all the juicy details about me and my wacky thoughts. That's right, it's my personal website! Join me for a wild ride inside my brain and let's see what kind of mischief we can get up to together.

First, let me introduce myselfâ€”I'm a cyber security professional with a Master's degree in Cyber Security from the University of Plymouth. It was an incredible journey that allowed me to sharpen my skills and expand my knowledge. I'm currently pursuing a PhD at the same university because, hey, when you love what you do, why not take it to the next level, right?

Now, let's rewind a bit and explore my roots. I hail from the beautiful country of Nepal, where I discovered my passion for computers. I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Jain University in India, where I spent four exciting years honing my technical skills and immersing myself in a vibrant culture.

So, buckle up and join me on this journey, together, we'll explore the ever-evolving cyber landscape. We will discuss new threats and vulnerabilities, all the while exchanging knowledge, insights, and a healthy dose of excitement. Exciting times await, my friends!
